# Learning Tensorflow repository tracking.
## This repository is used for tracking my learning process.
I start learning Tensorflow on 2 Jan 2024 and will write down the summary of the learning process every day starting with this day.

***2 Jan 2024:*** This is the first day that I started learning Tensorflow with "TensorFlow 2.0 Complete Course - Python Neural Networks for Beginners Tutorial" from freeCodeCamp.org I learned about 1 hr. so I was not used to knowing many things in Tensorflow on this day but I think this course it will helpful when I start learning deeper in field of DeepLearning.

***3 Jan 2024:*** Today I have learned a lot of machine learning algorithm(all of them are not Neural Network/Deep Learning) such as LinearRegression, Classification, Clustering and Hidden Markov Model(HMM). They help me to get more understanding about how TensorFlow works and What TensorFlow can do. And also the main concept of Neural Networks (How it is, What the algorithm behind it). And that is for today (^-^)
